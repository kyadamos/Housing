# WebScraper for Houses

My friends and I are looking for a house to rent, but every time we put together a list of houses for the realtor, half of them are already taken. I used this as an opportunity to learn how to webscrape with `BeautifulSoup`.

There are a few constraints that we have; for example, we want a house that has at least 3 bedrooms, allows pets, and has a garage. Also, the total utility from each house depends on variables such as cost or distance from our university or workplaces. In the future, we could use this data to solve an optimization problem and recommend a number of desirable houses.
